SuperHeroesUniverse is (going to be) a OpenSource Game. In the first place, it is being based on the commendline. In a long term view I'm planning to add GUI elements. The base of the level design is the SHU LevelLanguage, an easy way of expressing simple text-based adventures. This makes it easy to develop funny and exciting levels. For more information about the LevelLanguage, visit its documentation.
Next Steps:
- build the SHU LevelLanguage
- extend the LL with competition sequences
- build a GUI
